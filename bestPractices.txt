// Restful API best practices // 

// Prefix every route with /api
    ex. /api/lego

// Respond with status codes to provide feedback to the user 
    1xx - for information
    2xx - success 
    3xx - redirection 
    4xx - client-side errors 
        ex. "user already exists" 
    5xx - server-side errors 
        ex. "internal server error" 

// Allow filtering, sorting and pagination 
difference between filtering and sorting: A filter is a list of conditions that each entry has to meet in order to be displayed. Sorting is the process of arrange data record in sequential or systematic order.

// Only plurals for resource nouns 
    ex. GET: /articles/
            instead of 
        GET: /article/ 
    
    this is because it is ambiguous for the user to determine if the request will 
    return one article or all of the articles. So keep it consistent. 

// General tips 
    1. flat data is better and easier to use than nested data
    2. choose either trailing '/' or no slash 
        ex. POST: /entities 
            POST: /entities/
